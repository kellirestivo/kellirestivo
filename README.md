# I'm a PhD Candidate at Baylor College of Medicine under the mentorship of Andreas Tolias. I work at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, leveraging machine learning to study sensory perception. My current projects focus on characterizing the functions of neurons in mid-level visual cortex. I enjoy using predictive modeling techniques to probe difficult unanswered questions and expand the frontiers of neuroscience. In other news, my favorite hobbies are rock climbing 🧗‍ and classical piano 🎹
