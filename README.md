### Hi there 👋


I'm a PhD Candidate at Baylor College of Medicine in the [Tolias Lab](https://toliaslab.org/). I work at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, leveraging machine learning to study sensory perception. My current projects, in collaboration with the [Fabian Sinz lab](https://sinzlab.org/), focus on characterizing the functions of neurons in mid-level visual cortex.

I enjoy using predictive modeling techniques to probe difficult unanswered questions and expand the frontiers of neuroscience. In other news, my favorite hobbies are rock climbing 🧗‍ and classical piano 🎹
